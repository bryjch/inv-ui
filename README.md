## Inventory UI / [invUI](https://invui.netlify.app/)

Recreating game inventory UIs in the browser with React - exploring usability and design.

Project is just for fun to try making browser UI/UX with different kinds of interaction.

### Fallout

While playing Fallout 76, the inventory hotkeys felt unintuitive/lacking and wondered if there was a better solution.

### Minecraft

Super iconic inventory that has some great shortcuts that make it fun & fast to use.

### Tarkov

Never actually played before, but looks to have a very cool & in depth grid-based system that emphasizes inventory management.
